###Â Opinions

Attribute Based Pricing V2 is configured as a starting point (provides assumed functionality for pricing logic).

Business Rules Engine (Expression Sets and Decision Matrices) is being used (most of the config should be possibole using Calculation Procedures and Calculation Matrices but it is not tested).
